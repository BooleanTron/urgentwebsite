                Okay, let me explain everything. I know I haven’t been behaving well these days, and in a very short time, I’ve made you upset several times. I don’t have any explanation to justify my behavior—I’m going through a lot right now, and things are really, really tough for reasons I can’t share.

                I didn’t talk to you for two days, and those two days killed me. Today, I cried a lot, and after hours of introspection, I realized that I need to tell you that your presence is the thing I seek most right now. To make things right, I feel like I should tell you some things that I probably should or shouldn’t say (I don’t know, I’m so messed up).
            </p>
            <p>
                Do you remember the first day I messaged you? It was July 4th—I remember everything about that day so clearly. I talked to you more that day than I usually do with someone I already know. Not gonna lie, I definitely had a crush—I took a chance messaging you, and you seemed interested in talking. It was the best feeling ever... the best three days. But then, well, the replies started changing... Anyway, enough about that era. Let's talk about the start of college.
            </p>
            <p>
                I first saw you in DH2 when I was with Satvik, Kunwar, and Aadi—if you remember, Satvik approached you. I was sitting at the table right next to you, wanting so badly to talk to you but not having the courage to do it. I was honestly too afraid that if you saw my face, you wouldn’t even want to talk to me online. To be fair, it felt like a real fear at the time. Then I finally messaged you, and we met in the parking lot at Chilika. That was the first time I struggled to get words out—I was so nervous. But after that, well, you know how things went from there.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was deeply in love with you, but I was genuinely happy just being friends—I knew my limits. I’m ugly, short, not the smartest, and broke—everything. I knew there wasn’t even the slightest possibility of us being together. I just kept thinking of getting better each day so that maybe, in four years, I could ask you out and actually have a chance (even though I knew there was a glass ceiling I couldn’t break).
            </p>
            <p>
                Do you remember that little fight we had? I couldn’t stop crying that night. And then, the very next day, you told us you were leaving—I completely broke. I was barely able to hold myself together. The day you left, I wrote that note while I was having breakfast. In the middle of it, tears started falling, and after I handed over the note, I didn’t go to class. I went to the lake instead and sat there, crying for a full 40 minutes. I was questioning everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, when we started talking on the phone, you told me I was your best friend, and that was the happiest moment of my life. It meant the world to me. The thought of being by your side—and how much that might feel as a disgrace to you —was overwhelming. That level of acceptance really moved me.

But then, when you started talking about other guys, I didn’t know what to say because it hurt so much. Seeing you, someone I love deeply, not being treated right made me feel completely helpless. And when I told you about Avani, I felt terrible for lying and dragging a good friend into this tangled mess just to cover things up.
            </p>

                <strong>That was all bro. I love you a lot. I never think of being any thing more than this. It is just pure unconditional love - i love myself more than I do anybody else yet I love you more. It kills me whenever you get upset - I never intend to but i still hurt you, really sorry bro!</strong>
